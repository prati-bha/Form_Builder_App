There are two modules in the app
1. List
--> Land on this page and click on "Add Form". 
--> After creating at least one form, you can also edit the form by clicking on the form URL, the app will take you to same form and you can edit that form.

2. Manage Forms
--> Click on Add Question to add the question.
--> Add Questions and Submit the form. 
--> User can select type of question.


All the data is saved in localStorage. 

Due to time constraints, i was not able to
1. Create a page to submit the form responses. 
2. Write Complete test cases for the app.

--> I have added one test suit for list page, so that one can get the idea that i know writing test cases.

App is create react app, so just clone it and install the dependencies and to start run command npm start
